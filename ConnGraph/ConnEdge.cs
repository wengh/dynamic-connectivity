{
	/// <summary>
	/// Represents an edge in a ConnGraph, at the level of the edge (i.e. at the lowest level i for which G_i contains the
	/// edge). Every graph edge has exactly one corresponding ConnEdge object, regardless of the number of levels it appears
	/// in. See the comments for the implementation of ConnGraph.
	/// 
	/// ConnEdges are stored in the linked lists suggested by EulerTourVertex.graphListHead and
	/// EulerTourVertex.forestListHead. Each ConnEdge is in two linked lists, so care must be taken when traversing the
	/// linked lists. prev1 and next1 are the links for the list starting at vertex1.graphListHead or vertex1.forestListHead,
	/// while prev2 and next2 are the links for vertex2. But the vertex1 and vertex2 fields of a given edge are different
	/// from the vertex1 and vertex2 fields of the linked edges. For example, the edge after next1 is not necessarily
	/// next1.next1. It depends on whether next1.vertex1 is the same as vertex1. If next1.vertex1 == vertex1, then the edge
	/// after next1 is next1.next1, but otherwise, it is next1.next2.
