    /// <summary>
    /// A combining function for taking the augmentations associated with a set of ConnVertices and reducing them to a single
    /// result. The function is a binary operation for combining two values into one. For example, given vertices with
    /// augmentations A1, A2, A3, and A4, the combined result may be obtained by computing
    /// combine(combine(combine(A1, A2), A3), A4). In order for an augmentation result to be meaningful, the combining
    /// function must be commutative, meaning combine(x, y) is equivalent to combine(y, x), and associative, meaning
    /// combine(x, combine(y, z)) is equivalent to combine(combine(x, y), z).
    ///
    /// If a ConnGraph represents a game map, then one example of an augmentation would be the amount of gold accessible from
    /// a certain location. Each vertex would be augmented with the amount of gold in that location, and the combining
    /// function would add the two amounts of gold passed in as arguments. Another example would be the strongest monster
    /// that can reach a particular location. Each vertex with at least one monster would be augmented with a pointer to the
    /// strongest monster at that location, and the combining function would return the stronger of the two monsters passed
    /// in as arguments. A third example would be the number of locations accessible from a given vertex. Each vertex would
    /// be augmented with the number 1, and the combining function would add the two numbers of vertices passed in as
    /// arguments.
    ///
    /// ConnGraph treats two augmentation values X and Y as interchangeable if they are equal, as in
    /// X != null ? X.equals(Y) : Y == null. The same holds for two combined augmentation values, and for one combined
    /// augmentation value and one augmentation value.

        /// null argument can only mean that a vertex is explicitly associated with null augmentation information, due to a
        /// prior call to ConnGraph.setVertexAugmentation(vertex, null), or that the "combine" method previously returned
        /// null.
